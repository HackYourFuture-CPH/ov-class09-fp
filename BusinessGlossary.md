## Glossary:

AddedCost - Added cost in percentage facing the suggested route AftDraft - The
draft aft (stern) is measured in the perpendicular of the stern. It's measured
in meters. AvgSpeed - Average Speed in knots. A knot is 1,852 Km/h. DistOG -
Distance over ground in nautical mile. A nautical mile is 1,852 km/h. DistTW -
Distance through water in nautical mile ECA - Emission Control Areas are
designated areas where vessels can only operate with LSFO. ETA - Estimate Time
of Arrival. ETD - Estimate Time of Departure. ForwardDraft - in meters. The
draft forward (bow) is measured in the perpendicular of the bow. HFO - Heavy
Fuel Oil in Tons. LAT - Latitude. LON - Longitude. LSFO - Low Sulphur Fuel Oil
in Tons, it's the Fuel that is mandatory to use in the ECA. MaxWaveHs - Maximum
wave height in meters. MMSI - Maritime Mobile Service Identity it’s the ID that
is used for radio/frequency communications and it can be used as an unique
identifier of a Vessel. RPM - Revolutions per minute - It is a unit of
rotational speed or the frequency of rotation around a fixed axis. UTC -
Coordinated Universal Time.

## Other business concepts:

Vessels are the Ships from a certain Organisation Vessels go on Voyages which
can have 3 status, created, ongoing or completed. Voyages have Routes between
Waypoints. OV suggests routes between waypoints with the goal of maximising the
performance of the voyage and we call that Suggested Routes Every time
(typically every 12h) the captain of the ship reports back with the Vessel
Report OV processes the data of that report and creates new Suggested Routes
Waypoints are points on the map with Lon and Lat defined Ports are waypoints
(Lon, Lat) Organizations have operators and admins that can use the app that we
are developing and OV will have a Super User Admin that can Admin the whole app.
Users from the Organisations can only see and operate their own vessels and
routes. The Organisations can choose the type of report/optimization that they
want for their voyages and that means that OV will build their optimisations
based on this choice: and build 1 of these 3 reports Fixed ETA, Least cost
arrival, Earliest arrival.
