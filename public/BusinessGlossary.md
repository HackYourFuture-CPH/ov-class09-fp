##Glossary:

AddedCost - Added cost in percentage facing the suggested route
AftDraft - The draft aft (stern) is measured in the perpendicular of the stern. It's measured in meters. 
AvgSpeed - Average Speed in knots. A knot is 1,852 Km/h.
DistOG - Distance over ground in nautical mile. A nautical mile is 1,852 km/h.
DistTW - Distance through water in nautical mile
ECA - Emission Control Areas are designated areas where vessels can only operate with LSFO.
ETA - Estimate Time of Arrival.
ETD - Estimate Time of Departure.
ForwardDraft - in meters. The draft forward (bow) is measured in the perpendicular of the bow.
HFO - Heavy Fuel Oil in Tons.
LAT - Latitude.
LON - Longitude.
LSFO - Low Sulphur Fuel Oil in Tons, it's the Fuel that is mandatory to use in the ECA.

T##ypes of Users/Roles:
Super Users are only for the OV Staff
Admin Users are the specific Organisation Admin Staff
Operator Users are the specific operators of a certain Organisation Operators Staff

##Other business concepts:
Vessels are the Ships from a certain Organisation
Vessels go on Voyages which can have 3 status, created, ongoing or completed. Voyages have Routes between Waypoints.
OV suggests routes between waypoints with the goal of maximising the performance of the voyage and we call that Suggested Routes
Every time (typically every 12h) the captain of the ship reports back with the Vessel Report OV processes the data of that report and creates new Suggested Routes
Waypoints are points on the map with Lon and Lat defined
Ports are waypoints (Lon, Lat)
Organizations have operators and admins that can use the app that we are developing and OV will have a Super User Admin that can Admin the whole app.
Users from the Organisations can only see and operate their own vessels and routes.
The Organisations can choose the type of report/optimization that they want for their voyages and that means that OV will build their optimisations based on this choice:
and build 1 of these 3 reports Fixed ETA, Least cost arrival, Earliest arrival.
