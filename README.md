### The Customer - Optimum Voyage

https://www.optimumvoyage.com/

#### Optimum Voyage Operator Platform Vision

The platform is intended for ship (vessel) operators working in on-shore
offices. It is to function as the bridge between our cloud based service,
reportings from the ships and the onshore operators of the ships. The operators
(users) should at a glance be able toget an overview of their full fleets
position, activity and if needed a specific ship‚Äôs current status and history.
The operator will eventually be able to interact with our cloud service, but the
platform will to begin with be mostly a way to convey information from Optimum
Voyage to the operators.

##### Definitions:Operator

The operator is an onshore personal with the day to day responsibility for a
ship‚Äôs execution of a given voyage. The operator needs to be aware of the ship‚Äôs
position, fuel consumption, speed and the weather conditions it is experiencing.
In collaboration, (to some extent), the operator is also the decision maker
regarding route and voyage with the full overview of the economics of each.

##### Ship reportings

Upon departure and arrival a ship will send a standardized email with voyage
specifications. The ship will similarly every day at noon send a noon-report
containing specifications on current position, speed, consumption and more.

#### Database model

![DB Diagram](/db/Schema.png)

To get you started we have created a Database schema for you to follow. You can
see a preview above or you can go to
[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5d798d7283427516dc0b9212) This schema is
expected to change over the duration of the project, but since everyone is
working on the same project it is important that you follow some guidelines if
you need to change the DB.

1. First make sure you actually need to change the DB. We have put a lot of
   effort into modelling the domain, so don't change it just for the sake of
   changing it, but on the other hand there will likely be things we haved
   missed.
2. Write a migration using Knex.js that will perform the needed Schema updates.
   Make sure to test it thoroughly on your own branch.
3. Take the file `/db/Schema.dbml` and copy into the editor on dbdiagram.io.
   Make changes according to what you changed in your migration.
4. Copy paste the updated DBML code from dbdiagram.io and add it back to the
   `/db/Schema.dbml`.
5. Export the diagram as pdf. Take a screenshot and use it to replace the file
   `/db/Schema.png`.
6. Make sure to save the diagram on your dbdiagram.io account and use the
   "Share" button to copy the url and paste it into this readme file in the
   section above.
7. Commit the updated Readme, png file and DBML file.
8. Make a pull request with the updated schema files along with your migration.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Fork the repo and clone the repo to your local machine using a terminal or a git
client.

### Prerequisites

#### Mysql workbench

Install it from here:

Windows: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/

Mac: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html

#### Setting up on Windows

Only thing Windows users have to do is run the following command anywhere in
their terminal (not necessarily the project folder):
`npm install -g win-node-env`

Refer to
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11928013/node-env-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-comman)
post on stackoverflow for more info.

#### Install Node

Refer to this points on how to install on your OS:

- [Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Mac](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Installing

Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

#### Coding styles

Follow these best practices for coding:
https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/blob/master/review/review-checklist.md

This can be used as a checklist for every PR you make. Go through the list and
see if you have used all the best practices

##### Prettier

The Project comes pre setup with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a
tool that will automatically format your code. Prettier is currently set up to
format your code right before committing to git, so there should be no risk of
someone committing something that does not live up to our coding style.

You may, however, optionally install the Prettier VS Code extension to format
your code on every single save. This has the benefit that you will always be
looking at code in the right format and you will know exactly what gets
committed at any time.

In VS Code you can press CTRL+P (CMD+P on Mac) and type
`ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode` to install the extension directly or you
can browser and find it in the Marketplace.

Remember to enable "format on save" in VS Code settings. You can also enable
formatting on pasting or while editing, depending on your taste.

#### Environment variables

Environment variables are used for working with sensitive data like passwords
and usernames.

Fx connecting to a database, we dont want to commit the code that shows our
password. Therefore we use environment variables instead. The `.env` **SHOULD
NEVER** be commited!!!! Therefore it is in the `.gitignore` file (ignored by
git).

Here is how to get started with the `.env` file

- Copy and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

- Open the `.env` file and update any parameters according to the environment
  you are running.

#### Database setup

Working with sql we use a tool called knex which helps with writing queries and
with changing the database structure. Check these out:
https://www.quora.com/What-is-Knex-js
https://knexjs.org/#Builder-identifier-syntax

- Install knex cli globally with: `npm i -g knex`
- Update the connection details to the database in the `.env` file
- after the server runs and you see a `connection to <db_name> db successful!`
  message you are ready to migrate tables
- To make a new migration make sure you terminal is where the `knexfile.js` is.
  Otherwise `cd` into that folder! run `knex migrate:make MIGRATION_NAME`. Fx if
  i want to make a new users table i would run `knex migrate:make users`. This
  would set up the migration file (under the `migrations` folder) for me to
  write the users table.
- To make a new seed i would run `knex seed:make 01_SEED_NAME`. Fx
  `knex seed:make 01_USERS`. This would create a new seed file in the folder
  `seeds`.
- To then actually apply the migrations and the seeds, run `npm run db:setup`
- If it was successful you should now have the tables and seeds in the database

## ‚úàÔ∏è Working with migrations

Migrations are there to help manage your database when you are working in a
team. The goal of a migration is to take your database from one place (state) to
another. So it is bit like travelling. Traveling in time even?

We are trying to solve two main things with migrations:

- The pain of keeping the local database in your development environment up to
  date.
- The challenge of making schema changes to a database with real production data
  in a predictable manner.

Since are typically managed by writing ad hoc SQL to create the database, create
new tables, change tables and change the data inside the database, migrations
makes all of these tasks repeatable and predictable by basically adding all of
these changes to git. Essentially the solution is to never manipulate the
database schema directly with ad hoc queries, but always to out those queries in
a script that is stored in git. Furthermore, since git allows you to "travel in
time" by checking out past commits, changing branches, etc. we need a way for
the database to keep up.

### Up üõ´ and down üõ¨ migrations

We do so by having two types of migrations. There are up migrations (üõ´) that
describes how to travel somewhere and there are down migrations (üõ¨) that
describe how to get back home again. The down migrations are key, since these
are what allows you to take your database back to an old state whenever you are
checking out an old commit or a branch from before a certain up migration was
applied. A down migration must always be the exact opposite of an up migration.
A couple of examples in pseudo code (not real code! refer to the Knex section to
learn to write real migrations):

Creating tables:

```
up migration:
  create table products
    add columns
      "name", string
      "price", decimal

down migration:
  drop table products
```

Renaming columns

```
up migration:
  select table products
    rename column
      "name" > "product name"


down migration:
  select table products
    rename column
      "product name" > "name"
```

In some cases you might have real data in your database that you need to
transform in some way. Again you must be careful to write a down migration to
revert those changes:

```
up migration:
  select table products
    select "name" from products
      replace string "foo" to "bar"


down migration:
  select table products
    select "name" from products
      replace string "bar" to "foo"
```

### Working with Knex.js

Now we have an idea what migrations are it is time to introduce
[Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/). We use Knex.js to facilitate migrations, but it
does a few other things for us:

- Manage database connection
- Manage migrations and seed files
- Expose a CLI api to help scaffold migration files and run migration commands
- Provide an api to build SQL queries

### üîå Database connection

Knex.js helps us connect to the database quickly. Take a look at the
[Knexfile](/src/server/knexfile.js).

The file contains some database credentials (which are referenced from
environment variables for security reasons) and some configuration including
setting a path to the seeds directory. This file is really all you need to start
connecting to your database when using Knex.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Migration files in Knex.js

So we learned a bit about migrations, but how do you use Knex to make them?

Knex works by scanning the `/migrations` folder and looking for migrations _that
have not yet been applied to the database_. How does it keep track of this?
Easy. It has it's own table in the database `knex_migrations` where migrations
are added once they have been run.

### üå± Seed files in Knex.js

In addition to migrations which are generally concerned with updating the
structure or the "schema" of your database, Knex.js provides something called
"seeds". As the name suggest seeds are scripts that "plant" some data that can
later grow to something bigger. Often when you are building an application you
need to have some initial data in your application to test that everything
works. That might be the initial user that is able to then create more users,
organizations and so on, or it could be thousands of lines of data to load up
the application with realistic content for testing purposes.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Knex CLI

Make sure to always refer to
[the official Knex documentation for latest updates](http://knexjs.org/).

The project comes with the knex npm package pre-installed, but to use the api
smoothly it is recommended to install knex globally with:

```
npm install -g knex
```

(you might have to prefix the command with sudo if you get a write access error)

Note: When running knex commands you must always do so from the `/src/server/`
directory since knex will look for your knexfile in the directory you are
currently in.

Here is a list of some important Knex commands to know:

| Command                            | Note                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `knex migrate:latest`              | Run "latest" migrations (i.e. migrations that have not previously been run on your database). |
| `knex migrate:rollback`            | "Roll back" the latest migration.                                                             |
| `knex migrate:make migration_name` | Create a new migration file in the `/migrations` folder.                                      |
| `knex seed:run`                    | Run the seed files from the seeds folder.                                                     |

In addition to the commands above, we have a npm script called
`npm run db:setup` which is shorthand for running `knex migrate:latest` followed
by `knex seed:run`.

### Building queries in Knex.js

Knex provides a query builder interface. What it basically allows you to do is
to use an api to generate SQL similar to this:

```
const users = await knex
  .from("users")
  .select("*")
  .where({
    email: "hello@test.com
  });
```

Which will essentially generate the following SQL:

```
select * from `users` where `email` = 'hello@test.com'
```

In some cases using an API like that might be easier than writing raw SQL, as
there is less risk of making mistakes when trying to put together dynamic SQL
queries, concatenating strings and values from different sources. But on the
other hand, it also requires learning a new API which may add additional
overhead. We cannot provide the API documentation here, but you can find all the
instructions you need at [http://knexjs.org/](http://knexjs.org/). Furthermore
this [Cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/knex) might be helpful.

Using query builders like Knex, or even Object-Relation Mappers (ORMs), is
subject to much debate among developers. Some believe it is worth it learning to
use an API to interact with the database, others believe it is more value to
become good at using SQL, rather than abstracting it away. Using Knex' query
builder functionalities are _not mandatory_ for this project, but we find that
the API is simple enough that it might be helpful. _Using migrations, however,
is a mandatory part of this project_.

If you do not wish to use the knex query builder api, you can always use the
command `knex.raw()` to execute "raw" SQL statements against your database while
still leveraging Knex to connect to the database:

```
knex.raw('select * from `users` where `email` = "hello@test.com"');
```

## üíª Working with GIT <a name="git"></a>

Working with git is a HUGE part of the final project. This is how you should be
working with git in the final project:

This repo has two branches:

- `master` - Used for deployment. This branch should be as clean as is possible.
  NEVER directly commit to this branch!
- `develop` - A branch where we do all development. That means that all feature
  branches should be merged into this branch. Very important!

Lets get started with our first feature. Lets say we should build a cookies
popup:

1. Fork this repo. You now have a version of this repo on your profile. <<<<<<<
   HEAD
2. BEFORE WE WRITE ONE SINGLE LINE OF CODE, create the feature branch where we
   will do all our cookies popup development. `git checkout -b cookies-popup`
3. Now we write all our code in the `cookies-popup` branch, we make good commits
   that are not too bit, not too small! We push our branch so it is to be found
   in our forked repo. Cool, so far so good!
4. We now want the `cookies-popup` branch to go into
   https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/ov-class09-fp. We do this with a pull
   request (PR). BUT BEFORE we do that, there are a couple of thing we need to
   do before:
   1. Lets say it took a week for us to write `cookies-popup` and in that time
      there were 5 branches merged into the `develop` branch of
      https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/ov-class09-fp. Hmm that means that
      our `develop` branch on https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/ov-class09-fp is
      out of date. So if we just created our PR we our feature might not work
      (because the codebase was changed). Lets say that in one of the 5 commits
      someone gave the body a `z-index` of 1. Our popup has no `z-index`, so
      when the cookies popup should be shown it is not visible. So we need to
      sync our `develop` branch with class07 `develop` branch. Marta talked
      about that, but read this aswell:
      https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork
   2. Okay, so now our `develop` branch is in sync with class07 `develop`.
      Perfect! To get those 5 changes lets merge `develop` into `cookies-popup`
   3. **We now run our code** and see that the popup is not shown (see above
      why). Lets fix it by giving our `cookies-popup` a `z-index` of 2, create a
      new commit to our branch.
   4. NEVER commit something that is not running! You will break the build for
      everyone! so ALWAYS run the code before you create your PR.
5. Now we can go to https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/ov-class09-fp and
   create a PR that merges `cookies-popup` into `develop`. This PR is really
   nice, check it out:
   https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/class07-final-project/pull/89
6. Now we have made our PR, great. Someone is going to review this PR and might
   tell us to change a variable name. Now we simply make the change locally on
   the `cookies-popup`, make that commit, push it and this commit will
   automatically show up on the PR.
7. Everything look nice now and someone merges `cookies-popup` into `develop`.
   Awesome that was our first feature :) This maybe seems like a big hassle, but
   once you get used to it, it is not so bad! =======
8. BEFORE WE WRITE ONE SINGLE LINE OF CODE, create the feature branch where we
   will do all our cookies popup development. `git checkout -b cookies-popup`
9. Now we write all our code in the `cookies-popup` branch, we make good commits
   that are not too bit, not too small! We push our branch so it is to be found

## üíª Working with code <a name = "code"></a>

- ALWAYS run code before a PR is made!
- No committing `console.log`
- No committing merge conflicts!
- Work in seperate files! When you make a new feature, the first thing you do is
  create a new file for that (of course if it makes sense). Especially for
  components.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

There are two servers running:

1. Staging server - To deploy push to the `develop` branch
2. Production server - To deploy push to the `master` branch

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Web Framework
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Server Environment
- [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) - Database management

## ‚úçÔ∏è Authors <a name = "authors"></a>

- [@benna100](https://github.com/benna100)

## üìú Getting the HackYourFuture certificate <a name = "certificate"></a>

To get the certificate we need to make sure that you know our stack, for us to
recommend you to another company. So how do we figure this out? We look through
homework and we look through the commits you create in the final project.

Its important to say that you dont need to be an expert in everything, not at
all!! You can be more interested in the frontend or the backend, but we then
need to see that interest.

But if you are missing 4 react homeworks and the one you have committed is super
basic. AND we dont see some more advanced react usage, well then it becomes
super hard for us to recommend you to a company that does react. Because we
simply dont know if you have the skills.

If we fell there are gaps, we will talk with you as early as possible, so you
have time to show your worth!

If it comes so far that we cannot give you a certificate you can either join for
the next final project or make a project (or we give you a project) where you
show your skills. We truly want to give you the certificate and will help you as
much as we can to get you there!

A little more specific here is what we are looking for:

- Semantic html
- Styling
  - Responsiveness
  - Layout
  - If it looks pretty DOES NOT MATTER!
- Javascript
  - Variable naming
  - Function scope
  - ES6
  - `Classes`, `promises`, `map`, `filter` and all that shabang
- Node
  - Express
  - Nice structure
  - Can create an api using the database. CRUD
  - Everything modularized (Split into smaller parts)
- Database
  - Create tables
  - Queries
- React
  - Using the react way of developing, SUPER IMPORTANT!
    https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html
  - Knows how to use state and prop
  - Well designed components
  - Can use the api created from node
