### Optimum Voyage Operator Platform Vision

The platform is intended for ship (vessel) operators working in on-shore offices. It is to function as the bridge between our cloud based service, reportings from the ships and the onshore operators of the ships. The operators (users) should at a glance be able toget an overview of their full fleets position, activity and if needed a specific ship’s current status and history. The operator will eventually be able to interact with our cloud service, but the platform will to begin with be mostly a way to convey information from Optimum Voyage to the operators.

#### Definitions:Operator
The operator is an onshore personal with the day to day responsibility for a ship’s execution of a given voyage. The operator needs to be aware of the ship’s position, fuel consumption, speed and the weather conditions it is experiencing. In collaboration, (to some extent), the operator is also the decision maker regarding route and voyage with the full overview of the economics of each.

#### Ship reportings
Upon departure and arrival a ship will send a standardized email with voyage specifications. The ship will similarly every day at noon send a noon-report containing specifications on current position, speed, consumption and more.
